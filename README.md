# Persona-RPG
This is the main Repository for the Persona RPG :D

First of all I would like to say that I made this game because I was trying to find some Persona Tabletop RPG on the internet but I couldn’t really find one I liked. I made this to play with my friends, but later on I decided to invest more time and effort so it would become playable by other people too. There is room for feedback, even if I decide to not implement every single suggestion, so feel free to add issues and comment on stuff. But please, base your feedback on facts, with stuff that are in the Persona Games and I forgot, equations that should be updated based on newer and better versions and some more technical advice, that kind od thing is better than the classic “I just think this is bad”. Please teach me stuff don’t just say its bad, if you see inconsistencies please comment.


Well, to play this game you will need one ten sided die, here determined as 1d10, a calculator, probably pen, paper and eraser or some digital media to write things down and some kind of access to a tarot deck, which can be found online (https://rollforfantasy.com/tools/tarot-cards.php). Also remember that the story is more important than the apparent rules and having fun is more important than the story. 


The objective with this game is to, primarily, layout the rules and adapt them to be tabletop playable. When you read this pages you may find that some rules and mechanics are clunky or rough. This means that they have not been refined yet or I’ve overlooked them, so feel free to comment on things as long as it makes the game simpler to play but, keep in mind that it has to have similar statistics to the original games and the gamefeel cannot be compromised much.

This is more of an experiment to me and to have nice stuff to play in the future. This fan game is free and I don't plan to publish it but if you want to support my artwork and other content that I make, I do have a patreon at patreon.com/fmats.
